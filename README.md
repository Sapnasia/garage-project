Garage Database

The intention of the project is to design an app that would be used by service staff at a workshop. The app should have a basic CRUD functionality.

With User stories in Trello, I have set out what a service advisor would need to do, at a basic level the app should be able to add new customers recording necessary information, such as name and contact details, each customer should own at least one car, though owning more than one should be possible. There are three tables in the database. CUSTOMER (unique identifier customer_id) CAR (unique_ID Registration, as this is unique) and Job Unique ID job.


Users should be able to create new jobs, view them, modify them and delete them once complete. (Perhaps a more realistic thing would be archiving them, or changing status to delete, but jobs created in error could be deleted.)
